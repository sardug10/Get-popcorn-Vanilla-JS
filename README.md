### How to contribute?
You can contribute to this project in number of ways, it's upto your imagination. Also, if you want some suggestions about what you can do to contribute, I have listed you 2 issues that you can fix:-

1. **Not enough space for the details**
    If you click on some of the movies, TV shows or Actors to see their details, in some of the cases the details overflows the same as shown in the image below. So, you can do something to fix this like you can put the word limit such that it just occupies same space in each case. Rest upto your imaginations.

2. **Showing liked movies, Tv shows and actors seperately**
    Currently, liked movies, Tv shows and actors are visible at the same time no matter which tab is active. This creates an issue that, if you click on any of your liked TV show while your some other tab is active, it will show you the details of some different thing because the API used is different for each category so it will always use the API according to the active tab. You can try and see it on your own.

3. **You can make this website responsive**
    This web application is not responsive as of now. Try to make it so according to your imaginations.
